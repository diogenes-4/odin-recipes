        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p1>This chili dish, cooked slowly over a low heat, is perfect for a warm meal after a long day of work, with just enough spice to provide a satisfying kick.</p1>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 can of black beans</li>
                    <li>1/2 white onion</li>
                    <li>1 cup brown basmati rice</li>
                    <li>1 pound of lean ground beef</li>
                    <li>1 small can of tomato sauce</li>
                    <li>1 green pepper</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
                    <li>and a sprinkling of garlic and texmex cheese!</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cook the rice per your package instructions beforehand in order to save work later; it can be safely ignored as it cooks.</li>
                    <li>Begin by slicing your onion and green pepper, and cooking the onion in a large pot on medium-high heat.</li>
                    <li>After several minutes, add the ground beef to the pot and cook for around 10 minutes on a similar heat.</li>
                    <li>Next, add the beans and green pepper</li>
                    <li>Three minutes later, add the rice, tomato sauce, and various spices, mixing all ingredients together well.</li>
                    <li>Next, turn heat down to the lowest setting and leave the pot with the lid on for at least 30 minutes, although more won't hurt.</li>
                    <li>Finally, when you're ready to serve the meal sprinkly on cheese on your plate so that the cheese will melt as the chili cools.</li>
                    <li>Now, you can enjoy your meal!</li>
                </ol>
