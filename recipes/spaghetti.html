                <li>Up the heat to medium-high, add the ground beef, and break it into fine chunks.</li>
                <li>Around this time, prepare the spaghetti noodles as per the package instructions.</li>
                <li>Once the spaghetti is mostly cooked, add the pasta sauce and sprinkle the Italian seasoning on, optionally adding a small amount of water for a more watery consistancy.</li>
